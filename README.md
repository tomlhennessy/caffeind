Caffeind – Your Personal Caffeine Tracker

1. What's the problem?
Many people consume caffeine regularly but lack an easy way to monitor their daily intake, associated costs, and overall consumption habits. Without this data, it’s hard to make informed decisions about caffeine consumption and spending.


2. How am I going to solve it?
Develop a full-stack application that allows users to:
• Log their caffeine consumption by type (e.g., coffee, tea) and quantity.
• Track associated costs and total caffeine levels over time.
• Authenticate and store user data securely using Firebase.
• Provide a clear and user-friendly interface for tracking consumption trends.


3. Any issues I came up with?
• Data Management: Structuring Firebase to handle user-specific data efficiently while ensuring scalability for potential future features.
• Authentication Flow: Implementing a smooth login/signup process with Firebase Authentication while maintaining security.
• User Experience: Designing an interface that is intuitive for users without overwhelming them with unnecessary details.


5. What is the final solution?
Caffeind is a responsive web application that enables users to log their caffeine intake, view consumption trends, and monitor costs over time.
Key features include:
• Firebase Authentication for secure login and data storage.
• Dynamic summaries to help users track consumption habits.
• A clean and responsive UI built with React and TailwindCSS for a seamless user experience.
